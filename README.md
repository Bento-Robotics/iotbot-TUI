# iotbot-TUI

A control TUI with joystick support for iotbot robots  
https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/iotbot

This TUI can be customised, and the controls remapped via the `iot_tui.launch` file.  
Feel free to take "inspiration" (aka ctl + c), as I have tried to comment everything comprehensively,
and the ROS wiki kinda sucks.
